<p style=" float:right";>1. INSTRUCTIONS
Loosen the rice grains as much as possible with chopsticks or a spoon. Lightly beat the eggs until the whites and yolks are fully incorporated.
Heat up an empty, well-seasoned wok over high heat until it becomes very hot (smoke rises). Pour in 1 tablespoon of oil then swirl it around to coat the side of the wok. N.B.
See footnote 2 if using a cookware with non-stick coating.
</p>
 
 
<p style="float: right"; >2. Pour in the egg. Once it begins to set at the bottom, stir to help the running part flow. Use a spatula to scramble quickly so that it turns into small pieces. Transfer out and set aside.
Place the wok back on the burner. Add the remaining Â½ tablespoon of oil. Fry garlic until fragrant then add the rice. Stir and toss continuously until the rice is piping hot. Use the spatula to break any clumps.
Return the egg to the wok, along with scallions. Continue frying until everything is heated thoroughly.
Season with light soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and white pepper. Give everything a good stir. Dish out and serve immediately.
